## 🎮 About the Game

- **Select a wrestler** from a roster of legends.
- **Choose a match format** (Best of 3, 5, or 7 rounds).
- **Start the match** and enjoy detailed, play-by-play text commentary.

The game simulates matches using a strategic engine that factors in:

> **Built with AI Assistance**: AI tools helped optimize the game logic, improve efficiency, and refine commentary as I am not the greatest most experienced programmer. However, all wrestler data, creative decisions, and core mechanics were hand-crafted by the developer.
