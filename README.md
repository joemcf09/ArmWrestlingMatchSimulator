## 🎮 About the Game
**Arm Wrestling Supermatch Simulator** is a **text-based arm wrestling game** where you:
- **Select a wrestler** from a roster of legends.
- **Choose a match format** (Best of 3, 5, or 7 rounds).
- **Start the match** and enjoy detailed, play-by-play text commentary. That’s it!

The game simulates matches using a strategic engine that factors in:
- **Wrestler stats** (strength, endurance, wrist control, technique).
- **Move selection**.

Currently in its **early stages**, it’s a fun foundation with big plans ahead—like animations and deeper mechanics.

> **Built with AI Assistance**: Full transparency—I leaned on AI for alot of the HTML, CSS, and JS help since I’m still learning, I do fully understand that using AI for my full coding needs is a bad habit and bad practice, I am still learning. But the wrestler data, ideas, and mechanics? All me, with plenty of trial and error!
